Project Title: U.W. Leon Center Study Abroad App

Description:
The U.W. Leon Center Study Abroad App is a dynamic Android application designed to enhance the study abroad experience for students at the University of Washington's Leon Center in Spain. Leveraging a robust technological stack that includes MySQL for data management, Figma for user interface design, and a dedicated website server hosted by the University of Washington, this project aims to simplify and enrich the lives of students navigating their academic journey in a foreign land.

Key Features:

Interactive Map: The app provides students with an interactive map of the Leon Center and its surroundings, aiding them in discovering nearby amenities such as restaurants, libraries, and cultural attractions.

Academic Resources: Access to course schedules, syllabi, and academic resources directly through the app streamlines the learning experience, ensuring students have everything they need at their fingertips.

Cultural Insights: The app offers cultural insights and tips about living in Spain, helping students adapt to their new environment with ease.

Communication Hub: Stay connected with fellow students and faculty through the app's messaging and notification system, fostering a sense of community and support.

Events Calendar: Keep track of social and academic events, workshops, and excursions organized by the Leon Center, ensuring students don't miss out on any opportunities for personal and academic growth.

By seamlessly integrating technology with the study abroad experience, the U.W. Leon Center Study Abroad App aims to empower students with the information and resources they need to thrive academically and culturally during their time in Spain. This project exemplifies the University of Washington's commitment to innovation in education and student support.# uw-leon-app-new
